# 1515 extrusion cable routing clips

A clip-on attachment to 1515 extrusion (tested w/Openbeam) that has a channel for routing
cables, and secures any cables in the extrusion channel to the extrusion.

Use zip ties on the two sets of outer holes to keep cables in. Securing the clip
with a screw to the extrusion isn't needed in normal operation, but is there for 
anyone who really wants to.
